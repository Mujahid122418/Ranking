                        We select CBD products based on current trends within the market and products that are gaining popularity and in discussion. We contact the manufacturers to obtain samples. We then look through and verify the lab tests.
        
        We then give the product a score on Quality vs the product labelâ€™s claim, including price range. Our goal is for consumers to know what they are buying and how genuine the product is- especially in this growing market where many claims are made.
        
       <div className="summary-h1">Some of things we look for in particular: </div> 
        
       <div className="summary-h"><i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> Amount of CBD in the product against what the label states.</div>
        
        We compare the claims on the label against the actual content. We do this to ensure that people always get as much CBD as they see on the label. Any false claims will be revealed so the user is aware of this and able to shop reliably.
        
        <div className="summary-h"><i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> How much THC is present in the product.</div>
        
        CBD oils can legally have up to 0.3% THC content and still be called "THC Free." knowing the THC content in CBD products is important for people who are sensitive to THC. It is also critical for those individuals who compete in sports or have regular drugs tests so they know what they can use, safely and confidently.
        
        Are there any harmful solvents or heavy metals that have been detected.
        
        Cannabis plants are potential bio-accumulators of heavy metals. During production, a large amount of plant material is processed to extract concentrates and oils, thereby increasing the risk of heavy metal contamination.
        
        
       <div className="summary-h"><i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i> Is the price a reflection of the current market </div>
        
        when considering cost- the whole process needs to be taken into consideration- from production, labor, packaging, potency/purity testing and distribution. We look at the current market trend to give a general overview of price for CBD products.
